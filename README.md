## Some Comments

### `I've used the react-slick-carousel https://react-slick.neostack.com/`

### `I've added the Inter font from google fonts`

### `I've used the image graph from the graphQl documentation (I didn't know what is the purpose of program graph and where to use it !)`

### `I didn't know the purpose of the add button for each card (there is no useMutation hook in the documentation)`

### `I didn't use the pagination for the image query (if you want I can implement it for next version)`
